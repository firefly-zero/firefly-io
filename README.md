# firefly-io

Firemware for the second chip on Firefly Zero. At the moment, it handles multiplayer, buttons, and touchpad. It communicates with the main chip by passing binary messages over UART.

## Flashing

See flashing guide in [firefly-main](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-main). Everything is the same except you need to connect to the other USB port on the device.
